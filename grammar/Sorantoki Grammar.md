# Sorantoki Grammar Reference

## Preface

Sorantoki is a simple, clear, and friendly auxiliary language designed to make communication easy for everyone. It occupies a middle ground in the auxlang spectrum: more regular and logical than natural languages, but more natural and intuitive than highly engineered or philosophical languages. Its goal is not perfection on paper, but ease of learning and ease of use in real conversations.

The language has a single fixed word order (SVO), a very small sound system, and a completely regular grammar with no exceptions. Instead of verb conjugations or complicated endings, Sorantoki uses a straight-line chain of small helper words to express tense, aspect, mood, and other meanings. This makes sentences easy to build and even easier to understand.

Although Sorantoki has not yet been tested with learners of different ages or abilities, it was designed with accessibility in mind. The simple sound system, predictable spelling, lack of clusters, optional pronunciation variants, and regular grammar may theoretically support learners with different cognitive or linguistic profiles, including those who benefit from reduced memorization or clearer patterns.

Most importantly, Sorantoki is meant to feel welcoming. Its structure encourages calm, direct, and cooperative communication, and its vocabulary favors everyday meanings over complexity. This grammar presents the language as a practical tool: something you can pick up quickly, use immediately, and grow comfortable with over time.

### Your First Word

***wasa*** — pronounced *wasa, vasa, watha,* or *vatha* — is the first word most learners discover in Sorantoki. It means "I didn't catch that" or "The message wasn't received clearly." It can refer to unclear hearing, unclear speech, or simply unclear understanding.

*wasa* is a gentle, non-blaming way to ask someone to repeat, slow down, or clarify. It signals cooperation, not error. In Sorantoki culture, communication is shared responsibility: if something isn't understood, the listener uses *wasa* without hesitation, and the speaker repeats without feeling corrected.

Use *wasa* anytime you need clarity. It keeps conversations friendly, patient, and clear — exactly the spirit Sorantoki is designed for.

**Welcome to Sorantoki—an auxlang built to be kind to learners.**

## 1. Phonology and Orthography

### 1.1 Consonants

Sorantoki has ten consonants:

- **p** – like English "pet"
- **t** – like English "top"
- **k** – like English "kit"
- **f** – like English "fun"
- **m** – like English "man"
- **n** – like English "no"
- **s** – like English "see"; *th* (lisped *s*) is also fully correct
- **w** – pronounced as in English "wise" [w] or as in German/Dutch/Afrikaans "Victor" [v]; both are fully correct
- **y** – like English "yes"
- **r** – may be pronounced [r], [ɾ], or [l] depending on the speaker

*Note on s, w and r*: These are not allophonic rules based on environment, and not dialect clusters. All variants are fully correct, do not change meaning, and belong to the single standard form of Sorantoki. Speakers choose whichever variant is natural for them. Communication always supersedes precision.

### 1.2 Vowels

*a, e, i, o, u*

### 1.3 Diphthongs

*ai, au, ei, oi, ou*

### 1.4 Syllable Structure

(C)V|D(N) where N = *m* or *n*, D = Diphthong

- Allowed codas: *m, n* only
- No consonant clusters

### 1.5 Root-Level Rules

- If a syllable has VV, the next syllable cannot start with V (to prevent 3+ vowels in a row)
- If a syllable ends in /m/ or /n/, the next syllable can start with any consonant
- If a syllable ends in a vowel or coda, the next syllable must start with a consonant (to avoid vowel clusters)

### 1.6 Stress

Stress always falls on the penultimate syllable of the whole word.

- Prefixes (*noi-*/*noin-*, *pe-*) are counted normally → they can shift the stress rightward.
- Suffixes (*-n*, *-in*, *-ri*, *-ta*, *-pa*, *-ru*, *-ti*, *-ka*) and the plural marker are "invisible" to stress → they never take it and never move it.

Examples:
- *ká.sa* → *ká.san*
- *pú.ka* → *pú.kan*
- *pon* → *nói.pon*
- *sero* → *pe.sé.ro*

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Word Order

Strict SVO:

1. Subject
2. (Adverbs / Time words / Place words ...)
3. [TAM Serial Verb Chain]
4. (*si* | *kuno*) ← reflexive or reciprocal, immediately after the main verb
5. Direct Object / Stative Predicate / Complement
6. (Prepositional phrases, extra objects, etc.)

### 2.2 Modifiers

Always precede the head, including possessives and adverbs.

Adverbs of manner, time, and place (including *nau* "now", *supa* "already", *suno* "soon", *piko* "here", *weyo* "there", *rapiri* "quickly", etc.) are head-initial modifiers and immediately precede the TAM serial-verb chain.

### 2.3 Word-Class Flexibility

- Any adjective → verb automatically ("be Adj")
- Any noun → modifier ("N-like")
- Light verb *turan* = causative / "make X"

### 2.4 Copula

No copula verb. Predicates are zero-marked. *es* is an optional emphasis particle ("really is / indeed is").

- *mi es tokoto* = "I really am a doctor."
- *kasa es tai* = "The house really is big."

In Sorantoki, any root placed directly after a subject with no tense/aspect particle automatically means "be [root]". Therefore *tai* = "big / be big", *pon* = "good / be good", *tokoto* = "doctor / be a doctor", etc.

---

## 3. Pronouns and Plurals

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | *mi*     | *min*  |
| 2nd    | *tu*     | *tun*  |
| 3rd    | *ta*     | *tan*  |

Pronouns use *-n* suffix plural marking and are the exception to using the definite plural marker (section 6).

---

## 4. Noun Phrases

### 4.1 Structure

(Demonstrative) + (Number) + (Modifiers...) + NOUN + (Plural *-n*, if specific)

### 4.2 Demonstratives

- **ko** = this / these (near speaker)
- **so** = that / those (far or previous)

### 4.3 Examples

- *ko tai kasa* = "this big house"
- *so pukan* = "those books"
- *tai tinin* = "the big ones" (plural *-n* or *-in* attaches only to pronouns or to the generic noun *tin* "thing"; not directly to adjectives except *toun* "all")

---

## 5. Possession

Possession is marked with *te*:

**Possessor + *te* + Possessed**

- *mi te kasa* = "my house"
- *tan te mon* = "their money"
- *yan te tai korem* = "a person with a big heart"

### 5.1 Colloquial Spoken Variant

In casual everyday speech, *te* may be dropped when the possessor is a pronoun or with body parts and kinship terms:

- *mi kasa* = "my house" (colloquial)
- *tu puka* = "your book" (colloquial)
- *mi moran* = "my mouth" (very common colloquial)
- *ta peman* = "her family" (very common colloquial)

However, the forms with *te* (*mi te kasa*, *mi te moran*, *ta te peman*) remain the unambiguous standard and are recommended for learners.

---

## 6. The Definite Plural Marker *-n* / *-in*

Sorantoki has no indefinite plural. Bare nouns are used for generics and indefinite plurals.

- *kasa* = "house / houses" (in general)
- *mi peron kasa* = "I like houses" (any houses, houses in general)
- *ruwa in niran* = "Rain is cold" (generic)

The suffix **-n** (after consonant) or **-in** (after vowel or stem-final *n*) is added only when the plural referent is definite or specific:

- *ko tai kasan* = "these big houses" (specific ones)
- *so pukan* = "those books" (specific books we're talking about)
- *mi wita tai tinin* = "I saw the big ones" (specific big things, using generic *tin* + *-in*)

When the head noun is omitted, *-in* attaches to *tin* "thing" or (very informally) directly to the adjective:

- *tai tinin* = "the big ones"
- *pon tinin* = "the good ones"

---

## 7. The TAM Serial Verb Template

The verb phrase uses exactly six ordered slots. Only Slot 4 may contain 1 or 2 (a then b) verbs or nothing. All other slots accept exactly one particle or nothing.

| Slot | Name | Allowed particles / verbs | Can stack? | Meaning / Notes |
|------|------|---------------------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Tense | (empty) • *ya* • *wi* | No | *ya* = past, *wi* = future, (empty) = present |
| 2 | Aspect | (empty) • *in* • *pa* • *sa* | No | *in* = progressive, *pa* = perfect, *sa* = habitual |
| 3 | Negation | (empty) • *no* | No | *no* negates everything that follows it |
| 4 | Modal verbs / Phase verbs | (empty) a (• *kan* • *muso* • *wan*), b (• *sita* • *suto* • *pin* • *na*) | Yes (2 max: a→b) | can / must / want / start / stop / finish / imminent |
| 5 | Direction / Purpose verbs | (empty) • *to* • *ku* • *ki* • *po* | No | go-and / come-and / benefactive / in-order-to |
| 6 | Main verb | any legal verb | — | The real action |

Slot 4 allows exactly one modal (group a) + exactly one phase verb (group b) in that order: a → b → main verb. Never two modals, never two phases, never b before a.

### 7.1 Quick Reference Line

1 Tense (*ya* / *wi* / ∅) • 2 Aspect (*in* / *pa* / *sa* / ∅) • 3 Neg (*no* / ∅) • 4 Modal/Phase (*kan muso wan sita suto pin na* – stackable a→b) • 5 Direction/Purpose (*to ku ki po* / ∅) • 6 Main verb

### 7.2 Examples

| English | Sorantoki |
|---------|-----------|
| I ate | *mi ya monya* |
| I'm eating | *mi in monya* |
| I have eaten | *mi pa monya* |
| I was eating | *mi ya in monya* |
| I had eaten | *mi ya pa monya* |
| I will have eaten | *mi wi pa monya* |
| I will not come | *mi wi no ku* |
| I didn't want to learn | *mi ya no wan sero* |
| I want to start eating quickly | *mi rapiri wan sita monya* |
| I must finish coming here | *mi muso pin ku* |
| We will not be able to give money to you | *min wi no kan ki mon tun* |
| I'm about to eat | *mi na monya.* |
| I was about to eat | *mi ya na monya.* |
| I want to be about to come (= I'm planning to come very soon) | *mi wan na ku.* |

**NOTE:** The negation particle *no* negates predicates, not nouns. It is part of the serial-verb system and never functions as a derivational morpheme.

### 7.3 Note on Directionals and Phase Markers

***to* + Verb:** → andative ("go and do") when real physical motion to a location is implied
- Example: *mi to kasa* = "I go to the house" (physical motion)
- Example: *mi to monya* = "I go (there) and eat" (physical motion)

***na* + Verb:** → imminent → pure phase marker in verb chains (depending on sentence tense, it can indicate imminent past, future or present)

Examples:
- *mi na monya* = "I'm going to eat / I'm about to eat" (no motion)
- *tan pin na monya* = "They're about to finish eating"
- *ta pin na nesi* = "It's about to finish sleeping"

***ku* + Verb:** → venitive ("come and do") when motion toward the speaker/deictic centre is implied

### 7.4 Additional Examples

- *mi ya wan sero* → "I wanted to learn"
- *tu wi no kan ku* → "You won't be able to come"
- *tan pin na monya* → "They are about to finish eating"
- *mi wan ki puka ta* → "I want to give the book to her"
- *kasa ya sita kai* → "The house started to fall"
- *mi wan rapiri pesero po kan toki kon mutan* → "I want to be taught quickly in order to speak with everyone"
- *ta ya ku wita min* → "She came to see us"

### 7.5 Disambiguation Notes

***ki* in slot 5** (benefactive "to/for") is always inside the verb chain. Interrogative *ki* "which" is an argument and appears in noun-phrase position.

- *tu wan ki puka ta?* = "Do you want to give the book to her?"
- *ki puka tu wan ta?* = "Which book do you want to give her?"

***na* root** meaning imminent/prospective (modal/phase verb → slot 4) marks the entire predicate. Not to be confused with the separate root *nau* "now / right now" (used as a regular time adverb before the TAM chain; its adverb form is *nauri* "imminently").

- *mi na monya.* → "I'm on the verge of eating" (imminent).
- *mi nau monya.* → "I eat now / right now."
- *mi nau na monya.* → "I'm on the verge of eating right now."

---

## 8. Stative / Adjectival Predicates

### 8.1 Zero Copula (default and preferred)

- *kasa tai* → "The house is big"
- *mi tokoto* → "I am a doctor"
- *mon te mi* → "I have money" (colloquial "my money")

### 8.2 Optional Emphasis or Clarity: *es*

- *mi es tokoto!* → "I really am a doctor!"
- *kasa es tai* → "The house really is big"

*es* is especially helpful when the predicate could be mis-parsed as a modifier or possessive chain:

- *puka es in kasa* → "The book is in the house" (without *es*, *puka in kasa* could briefly be read as "the in-house book")
- *puka es ata te mesa* → "The book is on top of the table" (without *es*, it might feel like "the on-top-of-table book")
- *mon es te mi* → "I have money" (without *es*, *mon te mi* is the normal colloquial possessive "my money")

In everyday speech most people simply omit *es* and rely on context or word order, but adding *es* never sounds wrong and is warmly welcomed when clarity matters.

### 8.3 Becoming / Turning X

*sita* + stative/adjective = "become X, get X"

- *kasa sita tai* → "The house becomes big"
- *ta sita kouren* → "She gets angry"

---

## 8A. Possession, Existence, and the Verb "Have"

Sorantoki has no dedicated verb meaning "have". Possession and existence are expressed with the same structures that are used for location and simple predication.

**1. Simple possessive** (most common in everyday speech – identical to current rules)

[possessed] *te* [possessor]
- *mon te mi* → "my money"
- *kasa te tu* → "your house"

**2. Clear existential / possessive "have"** (recommended whenever context could be ambiguous)

[thing] *es te* [possessor]
- *mon es te mi* → "I have money" (lit. "money exists of me")
- *puka es te ta* → "She has a book"

**3. Negative possession**

[thing] *no es te* [possessor] or simply *no* [thing] *te* [possessor]
- *mon no es te mi* / *no mon te mi* → "I have no money"

**4. Locative and general existential** (always uses *es* for maximum clarity)

[thing] *es* [location]
- *puka es in kasa* → "There is a book in the house / The book is in the house"
- *yan es we?* → "Where is the person?"
- *mutan es piko* → "There are people here"

**Key learner rule** (added for compassion and predictability):

When you are talking about possession, existence, or location (i.e., when you would use "have", "there is", or "be located" in English), always add *es*.

Adding *es* is never wrong and is the safest, most understandable choice for learners and for anyone who wants to avoid even momentary confusion.

**Summary table**

| Meaning | Colloquial / short form | Clear / recommended form |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| my X | *X te mi* | *X es te mi* |
| I have X | — | *X es te mi* |
| I don't have X | *no X te mi* | *X no es te mi* |
| There is X in Y | *X in Y* | *X es in Y* |
| X is (located) in Y | *X in Y* | *X es in Y* |

---

## 9. Passive / Resultative

### 9.1 Prefix *pe-* on Main Verb

- *puka pewita* → "The book was seen"
- *mon peki ki min* → "Money was given to us"
- *ta peturan pon* → "It was made good / repaired"

### 9.2 Passive Agent Marking

Passive agents are marked by *kon*:

- *puka pewita kon mi* = "the book was seen by me"
- *mon peki kon ta* = "money was given by her"
- *kasa peturan kon seroru* = "the house was built by the teacher"

The particle *kon*, already used for instrument/comitative, extends naturally to passive agents.

Examples:
- *puka pewita kon mi* → "the book was seen by me"
- *mon pewita kon mi* → "money was seen by me"
- *mon peki kon mi* → "money was given by me"
- *kasa peturan kon tan* → "the house was made by them"

---

## 10. Questions

### 10.1 Yes/No

Sentence-final ***ka?***

Yes/No answers normally repeat the verb: *Pon ka?* – *Pon.* / *No pon.*

### 10.2 Wh-words (in situ)

| Function | Word |
|----------|------|
| what | *ke* |
| which | *ki* |
| who | *ye* |
| where | *we* |
| when | *wen* |
| why | *waya* |
| how | *moto* |
| how many/much | *kanto* |

---

## 11. Comparison

### 11.1 More Than

***maso ... pase ...***

- *ta maso pon pase mi* = "She is better than me" (lit. "She more good than me")

### 11.2 Most

***se moso***

- *ta se moso pon* = "She is the best" (lit. "She the most good")

**Note:** The particle *se* (the) optionally precedes superlatives for naturalness.

### 11.3 As ... as ...

***sama ... sama***

- *ta pon sama mi sama* = "She is as good as I am"
- *ko kasa tai sama so kasa sama* → "This house is as big as that house"

---

## 12. Relative Clauses

### 12.1 Marker: *su*

(with optional resumptive pronoun for clarity in complex clauses)

- *yan su ya wita ko puka* → "The person who saw this book"
- *yan su mi toki kon* → "The person I speak with"

### 12.2 Use of Resumptive Pronouns (optional)

Zero-resumptive relatives (without a resumptive pronoun) are fully native and preferred in everyday speech. Resumptive pronouns may optionally be included for clarity in long or complex clauses:

**Subject relative** (zero-resumptive is standard):
- *yan su wita puka* → "the person who saw the book"

**Direct-object relative** (zero-resumptive is standard):
- *puka su mi wita* → "the book that I saw"

**Oblique / possessor relative** (resumptive optional for clarity):
- *yan su mi toki kon* → "the person I'm speaking with" (standard)
- *yan su mi toki kon ta* → "the person I'm speaking with him/her" (optional resumptive for clarity)
- *kasa su min wita* → "the house we saw" (standard)
- *kasa su min wita te ta* → "the house that we saw (of it)" (optional resumptive; lit. "the house we saw of it")

The resumptive may be added when the relative clause is particularly long or complex, or when disambiguation is needed.

---

## 13. Prepositions

Only five true prepositions exist (everything else is done by serial verbs, adverbs, or zero):

| Preposition | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| *in* | in / at / on (static location or time) |
| *kon* | with (comitative) / by (instrument or passive agent) |
| *te* | of / from / possessive / material / partitive |
| *kausa* | because of / due to |
| *karo* | if (conditional clause introducer) |

---

## 14. Additional Particles

| Particle | Meaning | Placement | Examples |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| *se* | optional definite article; most common before superlatives | immediately before the noun or adjective phrase | *ta se moso pon yan* = "she is the best person"<br>*ko kasa se moso tai* = "this is the biggest house" |
| *es* | optional emphatic/existential copula ("really is", "there is") | after the subject, before the predicate | *mi es tokoto!* = "I really am a doctor!"<br>*puka es in kasa* = "there is a book in the house" |
| *e* | and (coordinates nouns, noun phrases, adjectives, or whole clauses) | medial conjunction (placed between the items/clauses it connects) | *mi peron puka e mon* = "I like books and money"<br>*ta monya e nesi* = "she eats and sleeps"<br>*mi ya wita ta e tu ya ku* = "I saw her and you came" |
| *o* | or (coordinates nouns, noun phrases, adjectives, or whole clauses) | medial conjunction (placed between the items/clauses it connects) | *tu wan monya o nesi?* = "do you want to eat or sleep?"<br>*mi wita mirou o nopai* = "I saw a cat or a dog"<br>*ta wi ku o ta wi teron in kasa* = "she will come or she will stay at home" |

**Notes on *e* and *o*:**
- They are simple coordinating conjunctions, exactly like English "and" and "or".
- They are never sentence-initial (except in poetic style).
- No comma is required before them, though a comma may be used for extra clarity in long sentences.
- They can coordinate full clauses without any additional marking.

---

## 15. Derivational Morphology

All roots remain phonologically legal (CV(N) syllables, no clusters, max 2 consecutive vowels)

### 15.1 *Noi-* Prefix (Opposite / Absence / Privative)

*noi-* (becomes *noin-* before vowel-initial roots) is a productive derivational prefix that forms the logical opposite, absence, or privative form of any root.

It applies to:
- adjectives / statives
- nouns
- verbs (privative or reversative meaning: "un-do / lose")

Functions:
- Creates the logical opposite ("un-X", "non-X", "opposite of X")
- Indicates absence ("without X")
- Creates privative or reversative verbs ("un-do X", "lose X")
- Does not express clausal negation (that function belongs to *no*)

Examples:
- *pon* → *noipon* (good → un-good / badish)
- *tai* → *noitai* (big → un-big / smallish, not big)
- *sama* → *noisama* (same → not-same / different-ish)
- *itam* → *noinitam* (alive → un-alive / lifeless, "dead inside")
- *es* → *noines* (exist → not-exist / nonexistent)
- *otem* → *noinotem* (find → un-find / lose)
- *moron* → *noinmoron* (love → un-love / loveless / lacking affection)
- *kasa* → *noikasa* (house → un-house / structure that is not a house)

**Notes:**
- *noi-* creates logical opposites, not necessarily the natural antonym (Example: *noirapi* = "un-fast," but "slow" has its own root)
- Learners should treat *noi-* as a regular, universal opposite prefix that can attach to any root without exceptions
- *noi-* is derivational, never part of the serial-verb negation system

### 15.2 Derivational Suffixes

Roots lack inherent syntactic categories; position determines function (predicate, modifier, adverbial). Suffixes serve two purposes:
- Lexical creation: *-ta, -pa, -ru, -ti, -ka* build new vocabulary that position cannot express (e.g., *seroru* "teacher" from *sero* "learn")
- Stylistic clarity: *-ri* creates explicit manner adverbs for emphasis or fluency; bare roots remain grammatical (e.g., *rapi* or *rapiri* "quickly")

Use suffixes from group 1 when you need the specific concept. Use *-ri* from group 2 when clarity or naturalness is desired (optional).

| Suffix | Function | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| *-ri* | adverb of manner | *pon* → *ponri*; *rapi* → *rapiri* |
| *-ta* | abstract noun | *pon* → *ponta* |
| *-pa* | action noun | *toki* → *tokipa* |
| *-ru* | agent / professional | *sero* → *seroru* |
| *-ti* | patient / result noun | *sero* → *seroti* |
| *-ka* | instrument | *toki* → *tokika* |
| *-ma* | ordinal number marker | *uno* → *unoma* (first); *senu* → *senuma* (tenth) |

**⚠️ Clarity Rule:** Roots should not end with derivational suffixes (*-ri, -ta, -pa, -ru, -ti, -ka, -ma*) or begin with *noi-*/*noin-* to avoid morphological ambiguity.

---

## 16A. Reflexives (self-action)

Sorantoki uses a single invariant particle *si* to mark that the object (direct or indirect) is the same as the subject.

- Position: *si* immediately follows the main verb (slot 6) and precedes any overt object or prepositional phrase.
- It never goes inside the TAM chain.
- It can refer to any subject (singular or plural, any person).

**Word-order summary:** Subject → (adverbs) → TAM chain → Main verb → *si* → (benefactive phrase, locative, etc.)

Examples:
- *mi wita si* → "I see myself"
- *tu moron si* → "You love yourself"
- *ta puku si* → "He hit himself"
- *min kui si* → "We wash ourselves"
- *mi ya ki mon si* → "I gave myself money / I helped myself to money"
- *tu wi no wan wita si* → "You will not want to look at yourself"
- *ta ya turan si pon* → "She made herself (become) good again (= She improved herself)"

**Notes:**
- *si* is obligatory for true reflexives; simply omitting the object means normal transitive use or impersonal/indefinite object.
- Body parts and clothing are normally expressed with colloquial *te*-drop possession, not *si*: *mi kui moran* (= "I wash my mouth/face"), *tu pake puka* (= "You put on your clothes"). Use *si* only when the action is emphatically directed back at oneself.

---

## 16B. Reciprocals (each other)

Sorantoki uses the invariant particle ***kuno*** ("one another") in exactly the same position as the reflexive *si*.

- Position: immediately after the main verb, before any other object or phrase.
- The subject must be plural or conjoined (*min, tun, tan*, or "*mi e tu*", etc.).

**Examples:**
- *min wita kuno* → "We see each other"
- *tun moron kuno* → "You (pl.) love one another"
- *tan ya toki kuno* → "They spoke to each other"
- *mi e tu wi pokan kuno* → "You and I will help each other"
- *min ya ki puka kuno* → "We gave books to each other"
- *ta e ye peron kuno?* → "She and who like each other?"

**Notes:**
- *kuno* implies mutual action; the verb is still grammatically singular in form because Sorantoki has no verb agreement.
- If both reflexive and reciprocal readings are possible, context decides; *si* forces reflexive only, *kuno* forces reciprocal only.
- To emphasize "each one did it to the other individually", add *uno uno* or *yan yan*: *tan puku kuno yan yan* → "They (each person) hit the others one by one."

**Quick reference table:**

| Meaning | Particle | Position after main verb | Example |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|---------|
| Reflexive | *si* | immediately after verb | *mi wita si* = "I see myself" |
| Reciprocal | *kuno* | immediately after verb | *min wita kuno* = "We see each other" |

## 17. Numbers

### 17.1 Cardinal Numbers

0 *oru*, 1 *uno*, 2 *tau*, 3 *sai*, 4 *pei*, 5 *niro*, 6 *kima*, 7 *tepu*, 8 *naso*, 9 *reko*, 10 *senu*

11–19: *senu* [1–9] (e.g. *senu uno*, *senu tau*, *senu sai* … *senu reko*)

20–90: [2–9] + *senu* (e.g. *tau senu*, *sai senu*, *pei senu* … *reko senu*)

21, 32, 45 …: [2–9] *senu* [1–9] (e.g. *tau senu uno*, *sai senu niro*, etc.)

100 = *pasan*, 1000 = *miran*

101–999: [1–9] *pasan* [rest] (e.g. *uno pasan*, *tau pasan sai senu pei*)

1000+: [1–9] *miran* [rest] (e.g. *uno miran*, *sai miran tau pasan niro senu tau*)

Larger numbers follow the same pattern and can be extended indefinitely.

### 17.2 Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers are formed with the suffix *-ma* attached only to the last element of the number. Stress falls on the final syllable of that element.

1st *unoma*, 2nd *tauma*, 3rd *saima*, 10th *senuma*, 11th *senu unoma*, 20th *tau senuma*, 100th *pasanma*, 1000th *miranma*, 21st *tau senu unoma*, 357th *sai pasan niro senu tepuma*

Examples in sentences:
- *ta ku tauma* = "She came second"
- *ko tai kasa ta sai pasanma* = "This big house is the 300th most expensive"
- *mi pin na sero rekoma tem* = "I'm about to finish the ninth lesson"

### 17.3 Zero

*oru* is used exactly like other numbers:
- *oru yan* = "zero people"
- *oruma* = "zeroth" (rare, but grammatical)

The entire system obeys all existing phonological rules (no clusters, only allowed codas, max two vowels in roots, etc.) and feels completely natural to native Sorantoki morphology.

## 18. Punctuation & Capitalization

(Everything is optional except when it removes real ambiguity)

### 18.1 Capital Letters

- All words are written lowercase.
- Exception: Capitalize only proper names of specific people, places, cities, countries, or when a common noun is used as a personal name or direct address.

Examples:
- *Maria ku.* – "Maria is coming."
- *Tokio es tai.* – "Tokyo is big."
- *Seroru ku!* – "Teacher is coming!" ("Teacher" used as the person's name)
- *mi seroru es Maria.* – "My teacher is Maria" (lowercase, because it's a normal noun here)

### 18.2 Allowed Punctuation Marks (only five – nothing else exists)

- . full stop (end of sentence)
- , comma (short pause, lists, non-restrictive clauses, vocatives)
- ! exclamation mark
- ? question mark
- " " quotation marks (for direct speech or titles)

That's all. No semicolons, no colons, no dashes, no apostrophes, no ellipses.

### 18.3 How to Write Direct Speech (quotations)

Use normal quotation marks. The sentence inside the quotes follows normal word order.

- *ta toki "mi moron tu"* → "She said 'I love you'"
- *mi wita puka "Sorantoki v5.1"* → "I saw the book 'Sorantoki v5.1'"

### 18.4 Commas – When They Are Useful (never required)

- After vocatives: *Maria, ku ko!*
- In lists: *mi peron puka, mon, e kasa.*
- Before/after extra information: *ko kasa, su ya peturan kon mi tata, es tai.* ("This house, which was built by my father, is big.")
- To avoid confusion in long sentences.

### 18.5 Everything Is Optional

If the sentence is clear without punctuation or capitals, omit them. Correct and equally native:

- *mi moron tu*
- *mi moron tu.*
- *"mi moron tu" ta toki*
- *mi moron tu! ta toki*

The language is designed to be spoken first. Writing is only a helper.

---

## 19. Imperatives

Drop the subject pronoun (2nd person is understood):

- *rapiri monya!* = "Eat quickly!"
- *no kai!* = "Don't fall!"
- *to kasa!* = "Go home!"

For politeness, add the particle *ko* after the verb:
- *monya ko* = "Please eat."

---

## 20. Existential / Locative Patterns

For stating that something exists or is located somewhere, the pattern *es* + location is commonly used:

- *puka es in kasa* – "There is a book in the house. / The book is in the house."
- *yan es we?* – "Where is the person?"
- *mon no es te mi* – "I have no money." (lit. "Money does not exist of me.")

For more on when to use *es* for clarity, see section 8A.

---

## 21. Full Example Paragraph

*ko tai kasa te min es se moso pon.*
*so yan su ya ku ki mon tun,*
*maso tan in no kan ku kausa ruwa.*
*ye su tun na wita wen kanto ka?*
*mi wan rapiri pesero po kan toki kon mutan.*

**Translation:** "This big house of ours is really the best. That person who came wanted to give money to you all, but they could not come because of rain. Who are you all going to see when [the time falls]? I want to be taught quickly in order to speak with everyone."

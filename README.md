# Sorantoki (lit. sun/day talk)
Sorantoki is a simple, clear, and friendly auxiliary language designed to make communication easy for everyone. It sits in the middle of the auxlang spectrum: more regular and logical than natural languages, but more natural and intuitive than highly engineered or philosophical languages. Its goal is not perfection on paper, but ease of learning and ease of use in real conversations.

The language has a single fixed word order (SVO), a very small sound system, and a completely regular grammar with no exceptions. Instead of verb conjugations or complicated endings, Sorantoki uses a straight-line chain of small helper words to express tense, aspect, mood, and other meanings. This makes sentences easy to build and even easier to understand.

Your First Word

wasa
pronounced wasa, vasa, watha, or vatha — means "I didn't catch that" or "The message wasn't received clearly." It can refer to unclear hearing, unclear speech, or simply unclear understanding.


wasa is a gentle, non-blaming way to ask someone to repeat, slow down, or clarify. It signals cooperation, not error. In Sorantoki culture, communication is shared responsibility: if something isn't understood, the listener uses wasa without hesitation, and the speaker repeats without feeling corrected.

# Sorantoki (lit. sun speak)

Sorantoki is a deliberately minimal auxiliary language and governance framework designed to explore how languages can be made **learnable, inclusive, and resilient over time**.

It is not presented as a finished solution or a universal replacement for existing languages. Instead, Sorantoki is a **reference implementation**: a working language accompanied by explicit rules for how it grows, who decides, and how authority transitions from a single founder to a community.

---

### **What makes Sorantoki different**

Most constructed languages focus on grammar and vocabulary. Sorantoki focuses equally on **how a language evolves once people begin to use it**.

Sorantoki combines three elements that are rarely designed together:

1. **Structural simplicity with predictable constraints**

   * No inflection or irregular forms
   * Fixed word order and a six-slot serial verb template
   * A small phoneme inventory with no consonant clusters

2. **Inclusive design as an engineering constraint**

   * Multiple pronunciation variants are equally correct
   * Single stress rule, no lexical stress
   * Optional clarity markers instead of mandatory precision
   * A cultural repair word (*wasa*) that normalizes misunderstanding

3. **Explicit governance before community scale**

   * A friction-based process for adding new words
   * Domain balancing to prevent lexical capture
   * Transparent decision rationales
   * Defined transition from founder stewardship to community governance

Sorantoki treats language not as a static artifact, but as a **shared system that must remain usable by real humans over time**.

---

### **Design goals (and non-goals)**

**Sorantoki aims to:**

* Minimize cognitive load for learners
* Reduce barriers caused by accent, speech variation, or working-memory demands
* Encourage calm, cooperative communication
* Grow vocabulary only when communicative need is demonstrated
* Remain inspectable, and governable

**Sorantoki does not aim to:**

* Maximize expressive density
* Replace natural languages
* Compete ideologically with existing auxlangs
* Enforce a single “correct” accent or register

---

### **Inclusivity by design**

Sorantoki does not claim universal accessibility. Instead, it deliberately reduces known sources of linguistic friction that disproportionately affect some speakers, including:

* Phonological precision requirements
* Memorization of inflectional paradigms
* Irregular stress and pronunciation rules
* Social stigma around “incorrect” speech

These choices are documented openly so they can be evaluated, challenged, and improved.

---

### **Governance and growth**

Sorantoki begins with a small core vocabulary and expands only in response to repeated communicative friction.

New roots are added when:

* Existing circumlocutions are demonstrably insufficient
* The concept is broadly useful
* The addition does not distort domain balance

All decisions are documented, attributed, and subject to future review. A formal governance charter defines how decision-making authority transitions from the creator to a rotating, accountable community body once participation thresholds are met.

Sorantoki is designed so that **no single person permanently owns the language**, including its creator.

---

### **Current status**
> Sorantoki is currently a personal research project of Lionel Coombes.  
> No legal entity exists yet; all assets are held in trust for the community.  
> Governance procedures are published for transparency only and create no legally binding obligations until an NPC (or equivalent) is formed.
> Participation, contribution, or reliance on these documents is voluntary and at the participant’s own discretion.

* Early public release
* Core grammar and lexicon established
* Bootstrap governance phase active (see [governance](https://github.com/setvir/sorantoki/tree/main/governance) for details.)
* Community growth intentionally slow

This is a language being grown carefully, not rapidly.

---

### **How to get involved**

At this stage, the most valuable contributions are:

* Reading and testing the language
* [Logging points of communicative friction](https://github.com/setvir/sorantoki/discussions/categories/friction-reports)
* Writing short example texts
* Reviewing governance assumptions

Root proposals are intentionally limited during the bootstrap phase.


## Your First Word

wasa
pronounced wasa, vasa, watha, or vatha — means "I didn't catch that" or "The message wasn't received clearly." It can refer to unclear hearing, unclear speech, or simply unclear understanding.


wasa is a gentle, non-blaming way to ask someone to repeat, slow down, or clarify. It signals cooperation, not error. In Sorantoki culture, communication is shared responsibility: if something isn't understood, the listener uses wasa without hesitation, and the speaker repeats without feeling corrected.

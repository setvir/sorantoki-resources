# **Sorantoki Bootstrap Protocol & Charter Activation Conditions**
*Interim Governance Statement – Version 0.9*

---

## **Preamble: The Campfire Before the Village**

Sorantoki is presently a **campfire**, not a village. This Charter is the blueprint for the village's governance, but we are still **gathering travelers**. Until the village has enough builders, the **campfire's founder** tends the fire alone, guided by the *spirit* of the Charter, not yet its full machinery.

This Bootstrap Protocol exists to **bridge** the founder's early stewardship to the **community-driven governance** envisioned in the Charter. It will **sunset automatically** when the village is ready.

---

## **Article I: Interim Governance (The Bootstrap Phase)**

### **Current Authority Structure**
- **Sole Decision-Maker**: The Creator holds **executive, legislative, and judicial authority** over all lexical and grammatical decisions.
- **Advisory Circle**: Early contributors (linguists, teachers, domain experts) may be invited to an **informal advisory role**. Their input is **non-binding** but **publicly documented** to ensure transparency and train future Project members.

### **Interim Lexicon Expansion**
- **Direct Proposals**: Root proposals are **submitted directly to the Creator** via a public forum.
- **Selection Criteria**: The Creator evaluates proposals using the **spirit** of Charter principles (phonotactics, morphological purity, high friction) but **without formal voting**.
- **Community Polling**: For **major proposals** (new derivational affixes, principle reinterpretations), the Creator may hold **advisory polls** to gauge consensus. These are **non-binding** but shape the Creator's decision.

### **Friction Logging (Early Stage)**
- **Friction logs are kept publicly** but are **not automatically triaged**.
- The Creator **personally reviews** logs to identify patterns and **proactively** solicit proposals for high-friction areas.
- **No voting thresholds**—the Creator adds roots when **communicative need is demonstrable**.

### **Documentation Mandate**
All interim decisions must include:
1. **The friction** that prompted the decision.
2. **The alternatives considered** (including circumlocutions).
3. **The principle justification** for approval/rejection.

This creates a **public corpus of decision rationale** that future Project members can study.

## **Article II: Charter Activation Conditions**

The **full Sorantoki Governance Charter** (Version 1.0) **automatically activates** when **all** of the following conditions are met:

### **Condition 1: Community Scale**
- **Minimum 200 active users** (defined as: has logged friction, proposed a root, or participated in a poll within the last 6 months).

### **Condition 2: Governance Capacity**
- **At least 7 qualified candidates** have **publicly volunteered** to serve on the Sorantoki Project.
- **Qualification**: Demonstrated via **successful root proposal** (approved by the Creator) OR **published linguistic analysis** of Sorantoki usage.

### **Condition 3: Infrastructure Readiness**
- A **functional friction logging system** exists, allowing users to submit, second, and upvote friction logs.
- A **secure polling mechanism** is in place for root selection, capable of **weighted voting** (to prevent domain capture).

### **Condition 4: Lexical Base**
- The **canonical dictionary** contains **at least 500 roots**, ensuring a **functional core** for diverse domains (not just the initial 180).

### **Condition 5: Temporal Milestone**
- **Minimum 18 months** have elapsed since the first public release of Sorantoki, ensuring **stability and battle-testing**.

## **Article III: Activation Protocol**

When the conditions are met:

1. **Creator Declaration**: The Creator **publicly announces** that the Charter is **triggered** and calls for **Project elections** within 30 days.

2. **Initial Project Selection**:
   - **First cohort**: The Creator **appoints** 2 members (to anchor continuity).
   - **Community elects** 3 members via **ranked-choice vote** (to ensure democratic legitimacy).

3. **Charter Ratification**:
   - The **full Charter** is **submitted to community referendum** (requires **60% approval** to ratify).
   - If rejected, the Creator and Project **revise** the Charter and resubmit within 60 days.

4. **Sunset of Bootstrap Protocol**:
   - Upon ratification, **this Bootstrap Protocol is nullified**.
   - The Creator's role **transitions** from executive to **principle-guardian** (per Article I of the Charter).
   - The first Project's term is **shorter** (1 year) to **stagger** future elections.

---

## **Article IV: Interim Amendments (The Sand-Line's Draft)**

This Bootstrap Protocol itself is **drawn in sand**:

- The Creator may **amend it** at any time to reflect **practical realities**, provided changes are **publicly documented** with rationale.
- **Advisory Circle** may propose amendments, but the Creator **decides**.

---

## **Article V: Transition Failure Safeguard**

If, after **3 years**, the activation conditions are **not met**:
- The Creator may **extend the Bootstrap Phase** for another year **or** declare **Charter activation regardless**, provided **Conditions 2 and 3** (governance capacity, infrastructure) are met.
- **Rationale**: A small but **committed and competent** community is better than a large but **passive** one. Governance cannot wait for perfection.

---

## **Article VI: The Spirit of the Bootstrap**

Until the Charter activates, the Creator **pledges** to:
- **Act as if** the Charter were already in force, **documenting** all decisions as if they would be **reviewed by a future Project**.
- **Delegate** minor decisions to trusted early contributors, **training** them for future Project roles.
- **Resist** the temptation to **permanently entrench** any interim rule, no matter how practical it seems.

**The goal is not to build a perfect campfire, but to teach the first villagers how to govern the village.**

---

## **Closing: When This Document Burns**

This Bootstrap Protocol is **temporary kindling**. When the Charter activates, **this document should be archived, not amended**. It is the **transitional scaffolding** that proves Sorantoki's governance was **planned for humans from the beginning**, not retrofitted after problems arose.

**Signed**:  
Lionel Coombes (aka Setvir), 

Creator and Founder

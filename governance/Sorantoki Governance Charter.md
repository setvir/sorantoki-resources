# **Sorantoki Governance Charter**
*Version 1.0 – The Line in Sand*

---

## **Preamble**

Sorantoki is designed for **kind communication**. This Charter exists not to constrain speech, but to **sustain the conditions** under which Sorantoki remains learnable, fair, and emotionally safe for all speakers. Governance is a **tool of stewardship**, not control. The rules herein are **drawn in sand**, not carved in stone—they must be visible enough to guide, yet erasable enough to evolve with human need.

---

## **Article I: Foundational Principles (Immutable)**

The following principles are **permanent** and guarded by the Creator. They may be **reinterpreted** but never **repudiated**.

1. **Phonological Charity**: All phonetic variants permitted by the Sorantoki inventory are **equally correct**. No speaker's accent is error.
2. **Structural Clarity**: The six-slot serial verb template is **immutable**. No exceptions, no inflection.
3. **Warm Register**: Stance particles (`ma`, `nu`), expressive reduplication, and phonetic softening are **optional, official, and eternally legitimate**.
4. **Root Purity**: All roots must obey CV(N) phonotactics and avoid morphological collision with derivational affixes.
5. **Derivational Logic**: The `noi-` privative, `pe-` passive, and suffixes (`-ri`, `-ta`, `-pa`, `-ru`, `-ti`, `-ka`) are **fixed in function**.
6. **Inclusivity Over Precision**: When in conflict, **ease of learning** trumps expressive density.

**Guardian**: The Creator holds permanent veto power over **principle-level amendments**. The Creator's role is **exegetical**, not legislative—interpreting principles in light of new evidence, not imposing personal preference.

## **Article II: The Sorantoki Project (The Rotating Senate)**

### **Composition**
- **5 members**, appointed for **1–2 year terms**.
- Terms are **staggered**: 2–3 seats rotate annually to ensure continuity.
- No member may serve **more than 2 consecutive terms** (term limits prevent entrenchment).

### **Mandate**
The Project is **solely responsible** for:
1. **Vetting** all root proposals for phonotactic and morphological compliance.
2. **Curating** friction logs and prioritizing proposals by **communicative utility**, not popularity.
3. **Balancing** domain growth to prevent **lexical swamping** (any single domain may not exceed 20% of new roots per cycle).
4. **Publishing** transparent rationale for all vetoes and approvals.
5. **Ambassadorship**: Evangelizing Sorantoki to **underrepresented linguistic communities**.

### **Selection Process**
- **Re-application required** for all candidates (including incumbents).
- **Hybrid selection**:
  - **3 seats**: Community vote (democratic legitimacy).
  - **2 seats**: Creator appointment (expert legitimacy).
- **Qualifications**: Linguistic aptitude demonstrated via **published analysis** of Sorantoki usage or **successful friction proposals**.

### **Accountability**
- The Project's decisions are **subject to community recall**: a **supermajority (70%)** vote can **censure** a decision, forcing reconsideration.
- Each member must publish a **departure memo** at term end, documenting **decision rationale** for future cohorts.

## **Article III: Lexical Evolution Process (The Sand-Line in Action)**
(This process should have a turnaround time of a week)

### **Step 1: Friction Logging (Demand Signal)**
- Any user may **log friction** for a concept that **repeatedly requires cumbersome circumlocution**.
- **Friction log must include**:
  - The circumlocution used.
  - Context of failure (why it was insufficient).
  - Frequency of need.
- **Low-effort logs are deprioritized** (the Project may require a **seconding** from another user to advance).

### **Step 2: Project Curation (Triage)**
- The Project **reviews logs weekly**, grouping by semantic domain.
- **Prioritization criteria**:
  - **Frequency**: How many unique users logged this?
  - **Urgency**: Does the lack of a root impede **critical communication** (health, safety, justice)?
  - **Universality**: Is the concept domain-specific or cross-domain?
  - **Expressibility**: Can the concept be rendered **clearly** with existing roots? (If yes, it is **automatically deprioritized**—the line holds.)

### **Step 3: Public Proposal (Design)**

- The Project **opens a call for root proposals** for the top-priority concepts (4 to 5).
- **Proposals must include**:
  - Proposed root (CV(N) compliant).
  - Etymological reasoning (source languages, recognizability).
  - Collision analysis (no conflict with existing roots or affixes).


### **Step 4: Community Poll (Democratic Selection)**
- **Finalists** (2–5 per concept) are posted for **community vote**.
- **Supermajority requirement**: A root must achieve **60% approval** to be added.
- The winning root is added to the **canonical dictionary** as provisional.
- **Attribution**: The proposer is **permanently credited** in the canonical dictionary.
**Note:** during provisional status the root can be added to friction reports at any time and depending on the amount of friction.

### **Step 5: Canonical Adoption (Integration)**
- After a year since inclusion the root undergoes a light review and is set to cononical status.
- The Project **publishes a migration guide**: how the new root replaces common circumlocutions.
- **Deprecated compounds**: If the new root renders a popular compound **obsolete**, the Project **acknowledges** this and allows a **3-year grace period** before discouraging the old form.


---

## **Article IV: Checks and Balances (The Sand-Castle Reinforcements)**

### **A. Creator's Reserve Powers**
- **Principle Veto**: The Creator may **block any proposal** that violates foundational principles.
- **Project Veto**: The Creator may **dissolve the Project** and call for **emergency elections** if the Project is **captured** (e.g., consistently approves domain-swamped roots despite community outcry).
- **Moral Authority**: The Creator's role is **persuasive, not coercive**. No formal power over lexical decisions that **do not breach principles**.

### **B. Community Override**
- A **petition of 20% of active users** can **suspend** a Project decision pending a **full community referendum**.
- A **70% supermajority** can **overrule** the Project's veto, **forcing** a root to be polled.

### **C. Domain Balancing Safeguard**
- The Project **tracks domain distribution** of approved roots.
- If any domain exceeds **20% of new roots in a 2-year cycle**, the Project must **pause** that domain and **prioritize** underrepresented domains (kinship, ecology, spirituality).
- **Rationale**: Prevents Sorantoki from becoming **"Tech-speak with a Clear Register."**

### **D. Sunset Clause for Roots**
- Any root canonical root can be **flagged for review** using the same friction report system.
- The Project may **deprecate** it via the same **poll process** (requiring 60% approval for removal).
- **Attribution preserved**: Deprecated roots remain in dictionary with **(archaic)** marker.

## **Article V: Community Participation Framework**

### **Rights**
1. **Right to Friction**: Any user may log friction **without censorship**.
2. **Right to Proposal**: Any user may propose a root **if invited** by the Project.
3. **Right to Vote**: Any user may vote in **lexical polls**.
4. **Right to Recall**: Users may **petition** for Project member removal or decision review.

### **Responsibilities**
1. **Good Faith**: Friction logs must be **genuine**, not spam or advocacy.
2. **Respect for Veto**: Users may **disagree** with a veto but must **respect the process** (re-applying members, recourse mechanisms).
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Users should **avoid** using deprecated compounds in **canonical texts** (but may use them colloquially).

---

## **Article VI: Succession and Continuity**

### **Creator Succession**
- Upon the Creator's **death or incapacitation**, the **Project becomes the sole guardian** of principles.
- The Project may **amend principles** by **unanimous vote** + **80% community referendum approval**.
- **Rationale**: The Creator's permanence is **moral, not immortal**. If the language outlives them, the community **inherits the guardianship**.

### **Project Continuity**
- If the Project **fails to fill seats** or **loses legitimacy** (e.g., <50% community trust), the Creator may **appoint interim members** or **suspend governance** for 6 months to restructure.
- **No permanent vacancies**: If a Project member resigns mid-term, the Creator **appoints a temporary replacement** until the next election.

---

## **Article VII: Amendment of This Charter**

The Charter itself is **drawn in sand**:

- **Amendments** may be proposed by **the Project** or **petition of 10% of users**.
- **Amendments** require **70% supermajority** in community referendum.
- **Creator's final assent**: The Creator **must approve** any amendment that **alters the balance of power** (e.g., changing term limits, veto thresholds).
- **Frequency**: No more than **one amendment vote per year** to prevent governance churn.

---

## **Article VIII: Dispute Resolution**

### **Lexical Disputes**
- **Collision claims**: If a user alleges a new root **collides** with their dialect/locale, they may appeal to the Project for **phonological review**.
- **Semantic disputes**: If a root's meaning is **ambiguous in practice**, the Project **clarifies** via **canonical example sentences**. No meaning-change without a **new root proposal**.

### **Governance Disputes**
- **Project vs. Creator**: If the Project and Creator deadlock, the matter is **submitted to community referendum** with **both parties' arguments published**.
- **Community vs. Project**: If users **recall** a decision (70% vote), the Project must **implement** or **resign en masse**.

---

## **Article IX: Final Authority & the Spirit of the Charter**

### **Ultimate Authority**
**The community's communicative need** is the final arbiter. All governance is **provisional** in service of this.

### **The Spirit Clause**
Any provision may be **suspended** in **emergency** (natural disaster, refugee crisis) if **the Project and Creator unanimously declare** that strict adherence would **impede life-saving communication**.

### **Living Document**
This Charter is **versioned**. Each version is **dated and signed** by the Creator and Project members. Old versions remain **archived**, but the **current version** binds all decisions.

---

## **Closing Statement: The Line in Sand**

Sorantoki is not a monument. It is a **shared camp** built for weary travelers. This Charter is the **agreement to keep the camp welcoming**, to **repair it when wind erodes the walls**, and to **let new builders redraw the boundaries**—but always **together**, and always **for the sake of the next traveler who needs a place to speak and be heard**.

*—End of Charter—*
